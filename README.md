## About

During the cohorts 3 and 4 of the Plutus Pioneer Program, this repository acted as a "documentation as code" hub for all the notes submitted by collaborators, to make them later available via HTML. It is built over the great work done by many cohort 1 and 2 students that shared their
notes on <https://github.com/nstankov-bg/docs.plutus-community.com>  

**Many thanks to everyone who collaborated!**
