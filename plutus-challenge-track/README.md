# Welcome to the Plutus Challenge Track 

We have two tracks for you to pick and explore:

- Plutus swap
- Marketplace

# Plutus swap
Here you have a simple swap Plutus validator. You'll have to use it to clear 3 stages.


## Prerequisites

You need to have these ready to start the challenge:

- GHC (8.10.7)
- Cabal (3.6.2.0)
- A running Vasil cardano-node (tag: 1.35.0-rc2)


## Challenge stages

### Stage 1
Understand the code and write a transaction that uses the provided validator using the cardano-cli.

### Stage 2
Make sure your validator is secure!

### Stage 3
Change both the validator's and cardano-cli's code to use:

- Inline datum
- Reference scripts
- Custom collaterals

# Marketplace

One of our partners (dQuadrant) prepared a Marketplace that lives [HERE](https://github.com/dQuadrant/cardano-marketplace).
A description of this example look at the `Hackathon - NFT Marketplace Challenge - Overview.pdf` in this repo.
